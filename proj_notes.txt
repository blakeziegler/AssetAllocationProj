Challenges Faced:

1. 
Problem: Tried "zooming in" a graph using the normalized data by just changing the date. 
Normalization was applied to the date range when the normalization was designed for the entire data set.

Solution: Created a derivative dataset in sql ("history_s&p_clean_DATE_DATE") and normalized the data
for each data range resulting in accurate graphs.


Current Conclusions:
- Possible large cap overcorrection from pre-covid small cap dominance (Mar08-Dec19)?
